Your new password needs to be at least 12 characters long and contain a lowercase letter, uppercase letter, and a number or special character. It can also not be one of the top 50 most commonly used passwords. <br><br>If you are changing your password from your desktop or a laptop that does not need to connect to the VPN because it is connected to DirectAccess, the previous rules apply with the execption of Step 1. Do not connect to the VPN on your desktop or a laptop already connected to DirectAccess as you are already on our network. <br><br><strong>NOTE:</strong> Be sure to sign into your laptop while you are in the office after you have changed your password. This is to ensure the laptop is aware your password has changed before you take it home. <br><br><strong>You are also able to change your password without connecting to the VPN at the following link: <a href='https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/ChangePassword.aspx?BrandContextID=O365&ruO365='>HERE: Change Password Link</a> <br><hr><br>" | Out-String
